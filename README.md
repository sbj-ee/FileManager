# FileManager

How the Script Works

Purpose: This script scans a specified directory for files older than 5 days, compresses them using gzip, and removes the original files to save disk space, mimicking logrotate functionality.
Key Features:

File Age Check: Identifies files older than 5 days based on their last modification time.
Compression: Compresses eligible files using gzip, appending .gz to the filename.
Original File Removal: Deletes the original file after successful compression.
Logging: Logs all actions (successes and failures) to a file (file_manager.log) and the console for monitoring.
Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors during file processing or compression.


Dependencies:

Uses standard Python libraries: os, gzip, time, datetime, pathlib, and logging.
No external packages required.


Configuration:

Modify the target_directory variable in the main() function to point to the directory containing the files you want to manage (e.g., /var/log/myapp).
Adjust the days parameter in the manage_files() function if you want a different age threshold.


Usage:

Save the script (e.g., as file_manager.py).
Make it executable: chmod +x file_manager.py.
Run it manually: ./file_manager.py.
Schedule it to run periodically (e.g., daily) using a cron job:
bash0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/file_manager.py



Safety Features:

Skips already compressed files (.gz extension).
Checks if the directory exists before processing.
Logs errors for troubleshooting without interrupting the process.


Limitations:

Only compresses files directly in the specified directory (not subdirectories). To include subdirectories, modify the glob pattern to **/* and add recursive=True.
Does not implement advanced logrotate features like size-based rotation or post-rotation scripts.



Notes

Permissions: Ensure the script has read/write permissions for the target directory and files.
Testing: Test the script in a non-critical environment first to verify behavior.
Customization: You can extend the script to delete compressed files older than a certain period or add size-based checks by modifying the manage_files function.

If you need additional features (e.g., recursive directory scanning, size limits, or deletion of old compressed files), let me know, and I can modify the script accordingly!How can Grok help?
